Just wanted a place I could put all the knowledge I've been gathering about Roland modules and pads

## Splitter cables
If you are using a non-entry level drum module, your module uses stereo cables for it's pads, therefore it is possible to split the cables that come to your pads from the module into two mono cables, doubling the amount of pads you are using. For instance, you can split the cable that takes the signal from the head and the rim of your pad and plug one into your pad and the other one into a cymbal edge (that would be a really good way to add a china to your kit without sacrificing an actual cymbal "space" on your module).


| Module | Splitable cables              |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| TD-4   | SNR, CR1, CR2, RD1, HH        |
| TD-9   | Every cable except KD and HHC |
| TD-11  | Every cable except KD and HHC |
| TD-17  | Every cable except KD and HHC |
| TD-25  | Every cable except KD and HHC |
| TD-30  | Every cable except KD and HHC |


### How to set it up
I'll be showing the setup and troubleshoot process on my Roland TD-9 Module.

First of all, you are going to need a p10 cable splitter, such as:
